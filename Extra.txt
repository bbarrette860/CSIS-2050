	During the Spring 2019 term, I was taking CSIS 1112 and there was a big final project due at the end of the term.
There was 6 of us in the group and we divided the workload between us so we can get the project done quicker. We had a
leader on the team that would take the code and compile it all together to show that it worked. The problem with this is
that we didn't know if we made any mistakes on our parts of code or what changes they made. 
	If everyone was using git and github then we would of been able to commit our code to the site. Then when someone 
would change some of the code there would be a message showing what was changed. Also comments could have been added to say
what needed to be added or changed. This would have definitely helped with making the project run smoother with the amount
of people in the group and less mistakes being made.
